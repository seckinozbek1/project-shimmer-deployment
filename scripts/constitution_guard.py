"""Constitutional-amendment tripwire (INFRA-029 enforcement).

Intercepts any attempt to MODIFY or DELETE an existing entry in
config/constitution.json `amendments[]` or `seed_laws`. Appending a NEW amendment
(the normal operator-approved DELTA path) is allowed. A modify/delete STOPS and
requires explicit operator approval via the operator-escalation pattern used
elsewhere in the codebase (an `operator_handler(topic, payload)` that returns an
APPROVE/DENY decision). Without an approving operator decision the change does
NOT happen.

No code path may bypass this: every writer of constitution.json routes through
`check_constitution_change` (Constitution.save and the snapshot load path). An
agent cannot bypass it — agents have no direct write path to constitution.json,
and the guard DENIES any protected change that arrives without an approving
operator handler (the safe default is refusal).

NOTE: when a UI is built, this approval MUST surface there too. A protected
constitutional edit must never proceed without an explicit human decision,
regardless of interface (terminal prompt today, UI later).
