"""Live model resolution + deprecated-model gate (INFRA-026).

The agent registry (config/agent_registry.json) is the SOLE source of each
agent's model, stored as a FAMILY+VERSION key (e.g. 'claude-haiku-4-5'), never a
concrete dated id. At run start the pipeline resolves every agent's family key
against the provider's CURRENT model list (queried live):

  * SELF-RESOLUTION (not a swap): if a family key is absent but EXACTLY ONE live
    id extends it on a separator boundary (e.g. 'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001'), it
    binds to that concrete id automatically and logs the binding to the run
    record. The concrete id is used in-memory only and is NEVER written to a
    tracked file (the registry keeps the family key). See resolve_model_id.

  * FIREWALL (unchanged INFRA-026 protection): if ZERO live ids match the family
    key (model genuinely gone/deprecated), OR more than one snapshot matches and
    none is exact (ambiguous), the run does NOT auto-pick. The operator must
    explicitly approve a replacement / pin a snapshot; an unapproved mismatch
    STOPS the run. This applies to both the Claude producer and GPT auditor sides.

Swaps to a DIFFERENT model are NEVER automatic. If a graphical or remote operator
UI is ever built, this approval step MUST surface there too -- a model is never
replaced with a different one without an explicit human decision, regardless of
interface (see enforce_current_models).
