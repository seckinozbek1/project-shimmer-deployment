"""OGE capture-at-run-end hook (build B1; ontology/SCHEMA.md RATIFIED Q1 + Q9).

Reads a FINALIZED run's per-run artifacts (the amendments master and the run's
delta_proposals.json) and appends them to the durable cross-run OGE stores under
ontology/stores/ (Q9: the OGE owns ontology/, kept separate from durable/). The code lives in
scripts/ to follow the project's prevailing flat-module convention (on sys.path, importable by
pipeline + the verify gate); the durable DATA lives under ontology/ per the ratified schema.

Two stores:
  ontology/stores/provisions.jsonl       append-only per-run provision capture (Q1)
  ontology/stores/delta_proposals.jsonl  cross-run proposal ACCUMULATOR (SCHEMA C1): one line
                                         per unique dedup key, merged across runs (occurrence
                                         count + first/last seen + operator status), not duplicated.

Masked-write gate (BUILD INVARIANT, day one, not retrofitted): every RAW field from SCHEMA
table D that this hook writes passes through mask_field(...), keyed on the run's sensitive-mode
signal (the pipeline's run_is_non_sensitive / redaction_enabled; we do NOT invent a new source).
Non-sensitive: real content. Sensitive: a typed placeholder [REDACTED:TYPE]. abs_path is never
written (Q7); provision node id is the composite (document_id, ref_id) (Q2); referenced-only REFs
become stub nodes (Q3).

Deterministic, local, no model calls.
