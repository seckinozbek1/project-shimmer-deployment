"""LAW-IV privacy SCRUBBER + leak gate (Mechanism 1, relocated in Phase 1b).

Always-on masking of operator-marked spans to [REDACTED] across every operator-facing
artifact, plus the post-apply grep that VERIFIES no span survives (a survivor BLOCKs,
a span located nowhere BLOCKs). Deterministic and LOCAL: no model, no web. This is the
testable privacy core the live phase and the verify gate both exercise.

BOUNDARY (shape a, INFRA-039 corrective): this module PRODUCES scrubbed content and the
survivor verdict and HANDS THEM BACK to the pipeline; it NEVER renders the deliverable
or looks up convention categories. The editorial render (amendment_render.
write_amendment_deliverables) and convention-category lookup stay on the pipeline side.
There is no dependency edge from here into editorial logic. text_extract is neutral
infrastructure (reads a .docx so the survivor grep can see rendered text).

Mechanism 2 (the dormant mask_for_external engine, LAYER_ACTIVE=False) is a SEPARATE
concern in this package; this scrubber does NOT call it and does NOT depend on it.
