"""LAW-IV full sensitivity-enforcement layer: BUILT AND WIRED (INFRA-041),
OPERATOR-ACTIVATED, currently INACTIVE.

This module is the pipeline's home for reasoning about sensitivity as a
first-class concept: masking sensitive content out of any API or web call, and
routing sensitive handling only to agents whose registry flag
`may_handle_sensitive` is true.

Wiring status, corrected in productization STEP 9 (the first line of this
docstring said "BUILT BUT UNWIRED (INFRA-038)" long after INFRA-041 wired it,
which is what this correction fixes). The layer is CALLED on every run:
`scripts/pipeline.py` consumes it at ten call sites, among them
`sensitivity_layer.is_active()` (the run hard gate, the BOOT date-web
suppression decision and the phase 9 scrub decision),
`make_outbound_prompt_masker` (chokepoint 1, injected into every agent wrapper)
and `make_query_masker` (chokepoint 2, injected into the search router). Inside
this package, `mask_text_for_egress` is the LIVE consumer of
`may_handle_sensitive`.

What is NOT on is the SWITCH, not the wiring: `LAYER_ACTIVE` is False, so every
one of those wired call sites no-ops (`is_active()` returns False and the two
masker factories return inert callables), and the run hard gate refuses to start
unless the operator passes --sensitivity-layer-inactive-override for THIS run.
Turning it on is `LAYER_ACTIVE = True` plus operator ratification: it is its own
DELTA, the operator's decision, never an agent's.

This is NOT a replacement for what ships today. The shipping mechanism applies
OPERATOR REDACTION RULES locally (LAW-IV's own phrase, "content marked for
redaction") via the Qwen redactors. This module is the larger outbound-masking
layer around it.

The inactive-layer hard gate (see require_layer_or_override) mirrors the Qwen
redaction --no-redaction-override hard-gate-plus-logged-override pattern: refuse
to proceed unless the operator declares THIS run non-sensitive, with each
override written to the governance ledger.

LAW-IV (cited, NOT modified): "Sensitive content … must be processed exclusively
by offline agents running on local hardware. No sensitive content may traverse a
network, enter an API call, or leave the operator's machine."
