"""LAW-IV privacy redaction stage (relocated + collapsed in Phase 1c).

This is the always-on final privacy pass (Mechanism 1) that used to live in the
editorial-side pipeline as `phase_9_redaction`. It now lives in the privacy home so
the editorial side holds NO privacy logic. The pipeline calls INTO this module for
the redaction pass (editorial->privacy direction, allowed); this module imports
nothing editorial (no pipeline / ladder / amendment_render / convention schema).

COLLAPSE (Phase 1c): the three-agent tier ladder (CLERK / AUTHORITY / GATE, T1-T5)
was the EDITORIAL review board mistakenly imposed on privacy. Privacy needs no
tiers, no escalation, no model self-test gate. It is collapsed to a SINGLE agent,
REDACTOR (derived from the proposing clerk). REDACTOR proposes redaction spans for
the judgment cases; the deterministic `redaction_detect` + operator rules catch the
regular-shaped PII every run; the scrubber consumes the merged result and VERIFIES
absence by grep (a survivor BLOCKs). The dropped AUTHORITY/GATE behavior was only
model self-checks (approve-a-subset + adversarial re-identification + binary gate);
no deterministic privacy guarantee lived there. Dropping them also removes the old
model-veto NOT_APPLIED path that could ship a document UNREDACTED, so the collapse
STRENGTHENS LAW-IV: every proposed + detected span is now applied and verified.

BOUNDARY (shape (a), from Phase 1b): the editorial RENDER stays on the pipeline
side. The pipeline injects two callbacks: `build_wrapper(name)` (closes over the
orchestrator + keys) and `render_deliverable(scrubbed_master, body_text, doc, info)`
(closes over amendment_render + the convention registry). This module never imports
those; it only calls the injected functions. So there is no privacy->editorial edge.

    redaction") - the model does NOT judge sensitivity on its own; it applies the
    rules the operator declared (INFRA-038). The deterministic `redaction_detect`
    catches operator-authorized regular shapes every run; the two are merged.

    When a redaction is detected/proposed it is applied THROUGH the canonical
    amendments master and the .md/.docx are re-rendered from it (INFRA-033) via the
    injected `render_deliverable` callback, so the formats stay consistent. Writes
    only inside the run folder (run_ctx); never touches durable/. Every decision is
    posted to the run bus.

    Collapse note (Phase 1c): there is no AUTHORITY/GATE approval/self-test stage and
    no NOT_APPLIED path. Every proposed + deterministically-detected span is applied
    and VERIFIED ABSENT by the post-apply grep gate (a survivor or an unlocatable span
    BLOCKs). This is strictly safer than the old model-veto path.

    Degrades safely (INFRA-034): the agent runs on the local Qwen backend; if it is
    unreachable, run_task returns ok=False and the phase BLOCKs that document with
    redactor_unavailable - it never crashes a keyless environment. (The Qwen-required
    startup gate is INFRA-035.)
