"""Canonical-master amendment renders (genesis Part XXVII §E / INFRA-033).

THE SINGLE CANONICAL MASTER for a document's convention-review result is the
`amendments_payload` dict, the same object serialized verbatim as
`deliverables/<doc_id>/review_data.json` (BP-16 per-document subfolder, doc-name
prefix stripped). The human-facing renders (`.md`, `.docx`) are PURE
FUNCTIONS of that master: master in → format out. They read amendment content
from NOWHERE else, so the three files cannot disagree.

`write_amendment_deliverables()` is the SINGLE ENTRY POINT that writes all three
formats from one `payload` object. Every per-run deliverable writer routes
through it; nothing else writes amendments.* files. This is the drift guard: a
future edit cannot reintroduce independent generation without going through (and
contradicting) this one function, which asserts the renders reflect the master.

Presentation-only inputs (NOT amendment content; they cannot change which
amendments appear):
  - document_name : heading text (cosmetic).
  - body_text     : the ORIGINAL document text — the canvas the .docx anchors
                    tracked-change marks into. It positions revision marks; it
                    never supplies an amendment. Amendments that do not anchor in
                    the body still render (in an "Additional amendments" section),
                    so the .docx always reflects the FULL master amendment set.
  - category_for_conv : optional callable conv_id -> human-readable category
                    label, used only to decorate a convention_ref that is ALREADY
                    in the master. Injected so this module stays decoupled from
                    the convention-registry shape.
