"""Qwen-required startup gate for the always-on redaction phase (INFRA-035).

Redaction is the final pipeline phase (INFRA-034) and runs on the local Qwen
backend. Before any agent runs, the pipeline confirms that backend is
reachable/configured. If it is not, the run REFUSES to start — unless the
operator explicitly waives redaction for THIS run (per-run only, never a
persistent setting), which is logged to the governance ledger.

HONEST SCOPE — what is verified pre-run vs at first call:
  Verified NOW (cheap, no model load, no paid call): torch + transformers are
    importable, and a qwen_local model id is configured in the agent registry.
    GPU presence is probed with torch.cuda.is_available().
  Verified AT FIRST REDACTION CALL (not here): the actual model load/download
    (transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained) and GPU placement. A local
    load can still fail at first use even when this pre-run check passes; the
    redaction phase degrades safely in that case (REDACTION_SKIPPED, INFRA-034).

GPU is a SOFT reminder only: if Qwen is configured but no GPU is detected, the
caller prints a "redaction will be slow on CPU" warning. That is never recorded
and never blocks.
