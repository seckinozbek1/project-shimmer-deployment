# Independent semantic review

Packet: review-f70eca4a38ee9d577f8d3136

Review independently without consulting authored labels, split files, or transformation metadata. Return semantic judgment, exact evidence, concise reason and ambiguity/refusal separately from formatting judgment. Producer item fields: span, claims, questions, uncertainty, status, refs; one per owned alias. Auditor item fields: finding, ref_ids, reasoning, severity, confidence. Use MATCH/DIVERGENCE/OMISSION/ADDITION for fidelity; refuse with items=[] and status=refused for insufficient evidence.

The effective time is missing. When does it take effect? The interpretation remains uncertain.\n\n"
